### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is LourenÃ§o, I'm from the Azores :dolphin:, and I'm a computer science and engineering and aerospace engineering student @ Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico in Lisbon, Portugal.

I'm always looking to learn new skills and stay active, so I also practice sports and give back to my community by tutoring mathematics to our future generations!

In my free time I love to create, wether it is by doing some video editing, graphic design or by taking some proud photos of my setup :smiling_face_with_tear:. Check out some of my work [here](https://www.instagram.com/codewithlouig/).

Please feel free to take a look around, check out some of my projects, and let's connect! I'm always open for a chat.
