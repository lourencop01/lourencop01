### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is LourenÃ§o, I'm from the Azores :dolphin:, and I'm a computer science and engineering and aerospace engineering graduate from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico in Lisbon, Portugal.

Throughout my life I've developed a passion for self-development and the creative world - leading to [CodeWithLou](https://www.instagram.com/codewithlouig/), the project I'm most proud of.

Please feel free to take a look around, check out some of my projects, and let's connect! I'm always open for a chat.
