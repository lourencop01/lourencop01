### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is LourenÃ§o, I'm from the Azores :dolphin:, and I'm a computer science and engineering and aerospace engineering student, currently studying at the Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico in Lisbon, Portugal.

I'm always looking to learn new skills and stay active, so I also practice boxing and give back to my community by tutoring mathematics to our future generations!

In my free time I love to create, wether it is by doing some graphic design, video editing or by taking some proud photos of my setup :smiling_face_with_tear:. I have over half a decade in experience working with the adobe programs such as Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, After Effects and Premiere Pro.

Please feel free to take a look around, check out some of my projects, and let's connect! I'm always open for a chat.
